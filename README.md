# Project-Machine_Learning


## Project Description:

Machine Learning course will focus on the end to end process of examining the data through a machine learning lens. One will not only get the basic idea behind some selected machine learning methods but also a detailed understanding of how, why, and when to use them. In this project you will focus on training and assessing a machine learning model, keeping in mind the ultimate goal of producing an accurate and credible version of it.

## Problem 1:
You are hired by one of the leading news channels CNBE who wants to analyze recent elections. This survey was conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables. You have to build a model, to predict which party a voter will vote for on the basis of the given information, to create an exit poll that will help in predicting overall win and seats covered by a particular party.

## Problem 2:
In this particular project, we are going to work on the inaugural corpora from the nltk in Python. We will be looking at the following speeches of the Presidents of the United States of America:
